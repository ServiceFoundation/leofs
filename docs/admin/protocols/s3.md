## Amazon S3 Interface
### Amazon S3 Official Documentation

* [AWS Documentation / Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) / Developer Guide / What Is Amazon S3?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html)

### How to determine the name of Bucket

* [Virtual Hosting of Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html)
* Values used for determining the name:
	* S3 uses a HTTP host header or a path segment in the HTTP request line
	* How S3 determines what to use depends on a domain name

#### 1. https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/path_to_file

In this case, a bucket's name is the first segment of a path.


| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| Request line | GET /bucket/path_to_file HTTP/1.1 |
| Host header| Host: s3.amazonaws.com |


#### 2. https://www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com/path_to_file

In this case, the name of the bucket is the part of the domain name before `.s3.amazonaws.com`.

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| Request line | GET /path_to_file HTTP/1.1 |
| Host header| Host: www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com |


#### 3. https://www.example.com/path_to_file

In this case, a bucket's name is equal to the `FQDN`.

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| Request line | GET /path_to_file HTTP/1.1 |
| Host header | Host header |

The argument of LeoFSâ€™ `whereis` OR `purge` commands should be "www.example.com/path_to_file".


### Naming Rule of a Bucket

We recommend as a best practice that you always use DNS-compliant bucket names regardless of the region in which you create the bucket.

* Bucket names can be as long as between 3 and 255 characters.
* Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), dashes (-) and underscores (_).
* Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.5.4).
* Bucket name cannot start and end with periods (.), dashes (-) and underscores (_).

### How to deal with Content-Type Request Header on PUT

Before 1.4.2, LeoFS had ignored Content-Type Request Header on PUT/POST and deduced the MIME type based on the file name extension and set that value to Content-Type Response Header on GET/HEAD. Since it turns out that this behaviour is different form AWS-S3 spec, we've decided to make it compatible with AWS-S3 spec while providing the old behaviour as well to ensure the backward compatibility for some users.

Since the old behaviour is set as default, if you want the new behaviour then you would have to set ``http.is_compatible_with_s3_content_type`` in ``leo_gateway.conf`` to ``true``.

#### Before 1.4.2

For example, say you uploaded the file named ``path/to/file.jpg`` with Content-Type set to ``image/png`` then on GET you would download the file with Content-Type set to ``image/jpg`` in accordance with its extention.

#### Since 1.4.3

For example, say you uploaded the file named ``path/to/file.jpg`` with Content-Type set to ``image/png`` then on GET you would download the file with Content-Type set to ``image/png`` in accordance with Content-Type included in the request.

#### Keep using the old behaviour even after upgrading to 1.4.3 or higher ones

It's possible to do so by setting ``http.is_compatible_with_s3_content_type`` in `leo_gateway.conf` to ``false``.
